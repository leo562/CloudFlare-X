Hello everyone!  
I am pleased to present my project based on Selenium (module: `selenium_driverless`), which allows bypassing CloudFlare without writing any code (just change the image to specify where to click). I hope you enjoy it!

Special thanks to the ChatGPT neural network (OpenAI) and the owner of the repository [selenium_driverless](https://github.com/kaliiiiiiiiii/Selenium-Driverless) for providing the module.

Enjoy and happy coding!


# install

1) pip3 install selenium_driverless
2) pip3 install pyautogui
3) python3 newbrowser.py (who runs on linux without a screen then - xvfb-run -a python3 newbrowser.py (install - apt install xvfb -y )
